Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing and maintaining software. It is important because it enables the creation of softwares that assist in the modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
They are development of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960 and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Gathering of user needs
Design - Creating detailed designs of software architecture and user interfaces.
Implemeentation - Writing codes according to the design specifications
Testing - Condcting tests to know if it meets user standards and set requirements.
Deployment - Release of software to users.
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support and updates of system after releasing to users.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - The stages flow from top to bottom. Step by step eg Requirements-Design-Implementation etc
Agile-Its flexible its delivered in cycles.

Waterfall scenario would be appropriate in making a construction project.
Agile scenario would be appropriate in making a healthcare project

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writes codes and implements software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software meets the required quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They help enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by giving developers features like code editors, version control, automated testing capabilities and debugging tools. 
Examples of IDEs Visual Studio, Eclipse
Examples of VCS Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges include change of requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt.
Strategies to overcome challenges may include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular  reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - individual components are tested.
Integration - interactions between different subsystems are tested.
System - the entire software system is tested.
Acceptance - its testing the software against the user specifications to ensure it meets their needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Its the giving or crafting of instructions or statements to get the best responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about Kenya
Tell me about the History of Kenya
It is effective because I have become more specific on what I want to know about Kenya.
